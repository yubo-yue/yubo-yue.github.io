## Principles

- SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- OCP (Open-Close principle - Open to extension, close to modification Principle)
- Principle of Least Knowledge (Law of Demeter)
	
    Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units: only units "closely" related to the current unit.
    Each unit should only talk to its friends; don't talk to strangers.
    Only talk to your immediate friends.

- DIP (dependency injection)
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
