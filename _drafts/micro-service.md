# Terms/Concepts
## 12 Factor App 
It is good to know new methodology of [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/). 
The motivation is to raise awareness of some systemic problems we’ve seen in modern application development, to provide a shared vocabulary for discussing those problems, and to offer a set of broad conceptual solutions to those problems with accompanying terminology. The format is inspired by Martin Fowler’s books Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture and Refactoring.
