# Discrovery.

Microservice inside company, outside company.

It is harder if you cross the boundary.

# Mapping - landscape API

navigate from beginning to ending.

## Swagger - one way help to build api MAP.


# Restful web Microservice

Where we come froms? Let's start from Ted Nelson

The Web

The words hypertext, hyperlink, and hypermedia were coined by Ted Nelson around 1965.

HTTP and HTML

We should work toward a system, in which generality and portability are important.

-Tim Berners-Lee, 1989

REpresentational State Transfer (REST)
REST emphasize scalability of component interactions, generality of interface, independent deployment of components and intermediary components. 

- Roy Fielding 2000

Microservices 

An approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own processes and communicating with lightweight mechanisms

- Martin fowler, 2014


Microservice Characteristics

- Make each program do one thing well (domain boundary -> DDD)
- Expect the output of every program to be the input of another program
- Design and build software to be tried early (tool building, CI/CD)
- Use tools to lighten the programming tasks (program to create  program, CHAOS army)
