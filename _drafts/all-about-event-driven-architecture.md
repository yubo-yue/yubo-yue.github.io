title:  " Event-driven architecture "

# At Beginning
It is a question i can't find answer for a long time, "What is event-driven architecture?". I understand a little about what it might be, but i can't explain it to others in very simple language and say, "Hi, now you know what is event-driven architecture". 

Recently, Martin fowler's presentation on GOTO 2017 give me a lot of insight regarding what is event-driven architecture. I want to make sure i understand it now and can explain it to others, so just write it down here. 

# What is "Event-driven" architecture

# What problems it want to solve?

# What are main characteristics of Event-driven architecture?

# Existing patterns for event-driven application

# What is Event Sourcing?
