## Words at begining
Recently, i start to learn Java 8, Scala, Lambda expressions, those interesting new stuff lead me to an new area of _Category Theory_. 

I can't stop myself to wikipedia what the _Category Theory_ all about. In case i can understand as much as possible,  i decide write down this blog page to help myself memory.


## Utitlity


	Word from wikipedia [Category, Objects, Morphisms] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory)
	The study of categories is an attempt to axiomatically capture what is commonly found in various classes of related mathematical structures by relating them to the structure-preserving functions between them. A systematic study of category theory then allows us to prove general results about any of these types of mathematical structures from the axioms of a category.
