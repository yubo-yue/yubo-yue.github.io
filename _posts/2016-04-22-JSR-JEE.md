## Overview
To be here, it is hard to follow J2EE evolution, JSR, JCP , a lot of concepts in Java community. So what is best for this is writing them down, and look it later to change it if it is incorrect and out-of-dated. 

In this way, i hope i can keep my memory consistent somehow.

## Concepts
JCP -> JSR ->
- J2EE 7
- J2EE 8

## JMX (Java Management Extension)
