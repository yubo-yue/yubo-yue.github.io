## Context
Thera are more situations recently i found need to take care of legacy code. 

## What's characteristic of your legacy code?

## What's your target of working with legacy code?
What is goal you want to achieve. There are a lot reason you want to touch your legacy code. Here we names a few:
* It is hard to maintain
* There are bugs ?
* It is not support new business requirements.

## The mechanics of change
For primary reasons to change software:
* Add a feature
* Fix a bug
* Improve design
* Optimizing resource usage

### Do we change behaviors or add new behaviors? Fixing bug or adding new feature?

### Refactoring
The act of improving design without changing its behavior is called refactoring. 

### Optimization
Optimization is like refactoring. but when we do it, we have different goals.
“We’re going to keep functionality exactly the same when we make changes, but we are going to change something else."

### to summarize
In general, there are 3 things can change when we do work in system: functionality, structure and resource usage.
