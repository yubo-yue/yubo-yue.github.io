# Objective
As growing older and older, it is good intent that the way to do thing is also growing. Here are a slew of wises learned during the past working and life. 

Put it here in order whenever i am stuck in some situation, hopefully can get insights and ideas from those wise. 

# Principles/Laws

1. Murphy's Law - if anything can go wrong, it will. 
2. Knuth's Law - "premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming".
3. North's Law - "Every decision is a trade off".
4. Conway's Law - "Organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations."
5. Law of triviality (Parkinson's law of triviality) - "Members of an organization give disproportionate weight to trivial issues"

# Tenets

1. If you think you are fully understand sth, then explain to other to see if they can understand.
2. Dont be afraid to challenges from others, if you are afraid, you are not fully thinking thoroughly and don't hold strong confidence on yourself. (To myself used to be afraid to join review session with peers and senior stuffs).
3. Work and life is full of sucks everyday, be smart, be diligent and away from angry.
4. When you think you know what problem is, step back, see it through from different angle and you will find what you think changed.
5. Always work backward. Clarify the problem you want to solve, define clearly goal to achieve, then looks back to see what you should do step by step.
6. Get little is always better than get nothing. You review with senior people or leadership for 3 proposals, you get all agree to 1 of your proposals is a win.
7. Sell your ideas. every people can see from different angles for same problem, that is unimportant, what really important is they all agree that that is really a problem.
8. Simplify and Invent is conflict, tradeoff come to rescue.
9. Simplify and Think Big is conflict, tradeoff come to rescue. Think big regards vision of future, simplify and invent regard the path to future.
10. "Divide and Conquer" is good strategy.
11. Policy and Mechanism separation.
