## Monad

In functional programming, a monad is a structure that represents _computations_ defined as a sequence of steps: a type with a monad structure defines what it means to chain operations, or nest functions of that type together.

Formally, a monad consists of a type constructor M and two operations, bind and return (where return is often also called unit):

- The _return_ operation takes a value from a plain type and puts it into a monadic container using the constructor, creating a monadic value.
- The _bind_ operation takes as its arguments a monadic value and a function from a plain type to a monadic value, and returns a new monadic value.


## Spliterator

An object for traversing and partitioning elements of a source. The source covered by spliterator could be, for example, an array, a Collection, an IO Channel, or generator function.
