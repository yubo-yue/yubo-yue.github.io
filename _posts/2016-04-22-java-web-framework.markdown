## Overview

I thought myself know a lot technologies, java, spring, hibernate, jdbc, ... But really? These years, i learned a lot of new techs, best practises, and a lot of other skills i can't remember where and how it happened. But recently i felt void, void than ever before. 

Think more on this, i thought i am lost in those so-called new techs, frameworks, ...  totally. I need to recall who i am and why i learn those things. 

So i think the best way to do it is from where you start your programming career. But... I can't remember where i start, but i feel like it is about building some really cool stuff web application. 

Then, at last, i decide to go back here. Do i really understand and know how to build a petclinic application in Spring. Here i go!!
