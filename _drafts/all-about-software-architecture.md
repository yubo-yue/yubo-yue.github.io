## Introduction

Software architecture is core part of complex software development. It is also one of most hardest part in software development lifecycle. Depends on the requirements, it requires author to describe it in different view with various concerns. But, as coding, it still has patterns/practices. 

## Agile Inception Deck
Copied from [The Agile Inception Desk](https://agilewarrior.wordpress.com/2010/11/06/the-agile-inception-deck/). The learn is ask those questions before the start of every project . 

- 10 questions to ask at the start of your next project
	- Why are we here?
	- Create the elevator pitch. A good elevator pitch tells people what your product is, who it's for, and why it's special in about the time takes to take a ride in an elevator.
	- Design a product Box. Think hard from your customer's point of view.
	- Create a NOT List. In Scope, Out of Scope and Unresolved categories.
	- Meet your neighbors. 
	- Show the solution
	- Ask what keeps us up at night.
		- Stuff we lose sleep over like Availability of the customer.
	- Size it up
	- Be clear on what's going to give. (Trade-off slider)
	- Show what it's going to give. (construction|UAT|Training|Ship it)

## Patterns

### Definitions

- From POSA: A system of patterns. A pattern for software architecture describes a particular recurring design problem that arises in specific design contexts, and presents a well-proven generic scheme for its solution. The solution scheme is specified by describing its constituent components, their responsibilities and relationships, and the ways in which they collaborate.

### How to descripe Pattern
Pattern is not invented, actually it is discovered. So the important thing is how to describe it.

#### Template from POSA vol.1
 
1. Name
2. Also Known as
3. Example
4. Context
5. Problem - The problem this pattern resolves, including a discussion of its associated forces.
6. Solution - fundamental principle.
7. Structure
8. Dynamics 
9. Implemations
10. Variants
11. Known Uses
12. Consequences
